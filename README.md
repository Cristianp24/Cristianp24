 # Hello!ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cristian Peralta

 # Who Am I?

"I am 30 years old. I am passionate about computers. Initially, I focused on PC technical service, for which I trained and have my degree. 
About 2 years ago, I started to get into development, and I really like it! I have a 2-year-old daughter who was my biggest inspiration to take this big and long leap, 
 and she motivates me to keep growing and learning."

My vision is to contribute to the technological world with innovation and creativity, helping to make our world a more interconnected and efficient place through technology.

I am filled with enthusiasm and eagerness to keep learning, growing, and collaborating on exciting technological projects in the future. Each day is an opportunity to acquire new knowledge and skills, and I am committed to making the most of this exciting journey in the digital universe.
